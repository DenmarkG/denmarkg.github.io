    My most notable accomplishment for NFL Pro Era was creating--then subsequently expanding--the coach confidence system. 
</p>
<p>
    The system took inputs from user gameplay and turned each situation into tangible feedback for the user. That feedback came in the form of Xp, as well as in the form of custom animation, voice, and lipsync to give the user immediate, immersive feedback.
</p>
<p>
    All the in-game inputs and outputs were implemented using a designer-friendly tool that allowed for nearly infinite situations to be designed solely in data. This meant that designers could create new situations without engineering support.
